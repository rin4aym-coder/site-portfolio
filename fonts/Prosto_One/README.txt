This font was created during a 6 month collaboration by two designers in Russia, Jovanny Lemonad and Pavel Emelyanov. They wanted to make a modern 'accidental grotesque,' useful for logos and presentations. The project's initiator and chief designer is Pavel Emelyanov, who worked with his mentor Ivan Gladkikh, known as Jovanny Lemonad, who helped with technical expertize to finalize the font.
